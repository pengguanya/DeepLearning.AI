### Link to Phoenix UI

You can open this link to check out the Phoenix UI and the uploaded dataset. You can use the same link to check out the results of the experiment you'll run in this notebook. 

**Note**: 
- Since each notebook of this course runs in an isolated environment, each notebook links to a different Phoenix server. This is why you won't see the projects you've worked on in the previous notebooks. 
- Make sure that the notebook's kernel is running when checking the Phoenix UI. If the link does not open, it might be because the notebook has been open or inactive for a long time. In that case, make sure to refresh the browser, run all previous cells and then check this link. 


```python
print(get_phoenix_endpoint())
```

## Setting up the Evaluators

Let's define the template prompts for the LLM-as-a-judge that will be used to evaluate the clarity of the analysis of tool 2 and the correctness of the entities mentioned in the analysis. For router evals, you will use the template provided by Phoenix.


```python
CLARITY_LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT = """
In this task, you will be presented with a query and an answer. Your objective is to evaluate the clarity 
of the answer in addressing the query. A clear response is one that is precise, coherent, and directly 
addresses the query without introducing unnecessary complexity or ambiguity. An unclear response is one 
that is vague, disorganized, or difficult to understand, even if it may be factually correct.

Your response should be a single word: either "clear" or "unclear," and it should not include any other 
text or characters. "clear" indicates that the answer is well-structured, easy to understand, and 
appropriately addresses the query. "unclear" indicates that the answer is ambiguous, poorly organized, or 
not effectively communicated. Please carefully consider the query and answer before determining your 
response.

After analyzing the query and the answer, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to 
justify why you chose either "clear" or "unclear." Avoid stating the final label at the beginning of your 
explanation. Your reasoning should include specific points about how the answer does or does not meet the 
criteria for clarity.

[BEGIN DATA]
Query: {query}
Answer: {response}
[END DATA]
Please analyze the data carefully and provide an explanation followed by your response.

EXPLANATION: Provide your reasoning step by step, evaluating the clarity of the answer based on the query.
LABEL: "clear" or "unclear"
"""
```


```python
ENTITY_CORRECTNESS_LLM_JUDGE_PROMPT = """
In this task, you will be presented with a query and an answer. Your objective is to determine whether all 
the entities mentioned in the answer are correctly identified and accurately match those in the query. An 
entity refers to any specific person, place, organization, date, or other proper noun. Your evaluation 
should focus on whether the entities in the answer are correctly named and appropriately associated with 
the context in the query.

Your response should be a single word: either "correct" or "incorrect," and it should not include any 
other text or characters. "correct" indicates that all entities mentioned in the answer match those in the 
query and are properly identified. "incorrect" indicates that the answer contains errors or mismatches in 
the entities referenced compared to the query.

After analyzing the query and the answer, you must write a detailed explanation of your reasoning to 
justify why you chose either "correct" or "incorrect." Avoid stating the final label at the beginning of 
your explanation. Your reasoning should include specific points about how the entities in the answer do or 
do not match the entities in the query.

[BEGIN DATA]
Query: {query}
Answer: {response}
[END DATA]
Please analyze the data carefully and provide an explanation followed by your response.

EXPLANATION: Provide your reasoning step by step, evaluating whether the entities in the answer are 
correct and consistent with the query.
LABEL: "correct" or "incorrect"
"""
```

The following evaluators are set up to take in as parameters: input, output and expected. Here are the structures and meaning of these parameters:
- **input**: this is the input field of your dataset examples that you just created. It has only one key: "question" (as defined in a previous cell).
- **output**: this is the output field added to your dataset examples, after you apply the task to each example. The structure of this output is defined by the task, which is defined in a subsequent cell (as `run_agent_task`). This task returns a processed version of the agent's messages (you can check `process_messages` in `utils.py`): it is a dictionary that organizes the messages into these keys: "tool_calls", "tool_responses", "final_output", "unchanged_messages" and "path_length".
- **expected**: this is the expected output field of your dataset examples that you created in a previous cell. It has two keys: "sql_result" and "sql_generated".

## Running the Experiment

<p style="background-color:#f7fff8; padding:15px; border-width:3px; border-color:#e0f0e0; border-style:solid; border-radius:6px"> 🚨
&nbsp; <b>Different Run Results:</b> The output generated by AI chat models can vary with each execution due to their dynamic, probabilistic nature. Your results might differ from those shown in the video. The warnings are also not printed in this notebook.</p> 


```python
experiment = run_experiment(dataset,
                            run_agent_task,
                            evaluators=[function_calling_eval,

                                        evaluate_entity_correctness, 
                                        code_is_runnable],

## Running the Experiment - Change in Prompt


```python

Do not reply with anything besides the SQL query.
The prompt is: {prompt}

The available columns are: {columns}
The table name is: {table_name}

```


```python
update_sql_gen_prompt(new_prompt)
```


```python
experiment = run_experiment(dataset,
                            run_agent_task,
                            evaluators=[function_calling_eval,

## Optional - Playground in Phoenix

Alternatively, you can try the playground feature in Phoenix UI to change the prompt and compare the results. You can run the following cells to get the prompt that you can input in the UI.

**Note** that this is an optional part, and the OpenAI key is only provided in this notebook and not in the Phoenix server. 


```python
from utils import get_sql_gen_prompt
```


```python
print(get_sql_gen_prompt())
